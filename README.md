Neovim Configs in Lua

Not a substitute for a actual distribution as AstroVim or SpaceVim, but just a reference.

It contains the following Plugins:
  * Lua-Line
  * Nvim-Tree
  * Telescope
  * TokyoNight theme
  * TreeSitter
  * Which-Key
  
This is a configuration that has some bugs, use it only as a reference.

# Current Bugs:
  * Lsp-Server not working with Which-Key.
